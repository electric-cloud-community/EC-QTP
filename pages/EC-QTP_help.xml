    <!-- The tool description should answer these kinds of questions:
    What is the tool itself is used for in the development
    process? Who would use this tool? What is the general use-case or
    problem that this tool solves? Look at the tool's documentation or
    website(s) to get their own descriptions. Look at Wikipedia or other
    outside websites. If there is a Hudson plugin, read their
    documentation for ideas, examples, etc. It's OK to copy word-for-word
    only if appropriate, such as FOSS - but not commercial software.

    <p>HP QuickTest Professional software provides functional and
    regression test automation for software applications and
    environments. Part of the HP Quality Center tool suite, HP
    QuickTest Professional can be used for enterprise quality
    assurance. HP QuickTest Professional supports keyword and
    scripting interfaces and features a graphical user interface.
    It uses the Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) scripting
    language to specify a test procedure, and to manipulate the
    objects and controls of the application under test.</p>

    <h2>ElectricFlow Integration to HP QuickTest Pro</h2>
    <!-- The integration description should answer the questions:
    How deep does our integration go? Why should I care? What general
    functionality does the plugin include? What functionality does
    the plugin omit?
    -->

    <p>The EC-QTP plugin enables you to run tests on QuickTest Pro
    Server. The plugin also reads the results of the tests and
    displays on the job summary</p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Access to the machine where QuickTest Pro is installed is
      required to use the plugin. All code is executed on the
      ElectricFlow server machine using an agent. The QTP API
      is available only on the machine where QTP is installed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Integrated Version</h2>

    <p>This plugin was developed and tested against version
    11.0</p>

    <h1>Plugin Procedures</h1>

    <!-- This section is for examples and use cases, including screenshots of the new Parameter Panel with example values filled in.
    Unfortunately, I can't tell you what exactly to put here, but it's OK to put what seems like too much! Include both parameter
    values and output where appropriate. Use a separate 'h2' header for each example. Under the h2 header try to stay with the style
    outline used above where possible.
